Overview of the Project

This project involves applying Random Forest Regression to a dataset containing three numerical features:

1. Humidity (relative humidity)

2. Pressure (hectopascal)

3. Temperature (celsius, target variable)

The objective is to predict the Temperature values based on Humidity and Pressure using the Random Forest algorithm. Additionally, the correlation matrix is
generated to analyze relationships between the features.



Conclusion

The Random Forest Regression model performed well on the given dataset, achieving an MSE of 1.3295 and an R² score of 0.6503.
The correlation matrix provided valuable insights into the relationships between features, highlighting key dependencies.
While the results are promising, further tuning and feature engineering could enhance model performance.
